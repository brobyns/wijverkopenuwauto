# Liquid Tether

Liquid Tether combines the ideas behind
[Ember Tether](https://github.com/yapplabs/ember-tether.git) with the power of
[Liquid Fire](http://ef4.github.io/liquid-fire/) to provide an accessible,
easy-to-use toolkit for both positioning & animating UI elements.

Interactive documentation can be found
[here](http://pzuraq.github.io/liquid-tether/).

## Ember Compatibility

Liquid Tether is tested on all versions of Ember >= 1.13. Long term support will
continue for 1.13 and up for as long Ember core support continues.

## Installation

```
ember install liquid-tether
```
